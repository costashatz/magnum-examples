        integration with @ref SceneGraph
    -   @ref examples-ovr example showing integration with Oculus VR using
        @ref OvrIntegration

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-changes Changes and improvements

-   Relicensed all examples from MIT to public domain / UNLICENSE to allow
    their unencumered use in derived projects
-   Removed now obsolete `framebuffer` example, superseded by the
    @ref examples-picking example
-   The @ref examples-motionblur example now uses VSync and
    minimal frame time to avoid being a CPU hog

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-buildsystem Build system

-   Continuous testing for Linux, macOS, Windows MSVC, Windows MinGW, Windows RT,
    iOS, Android and Emscripten on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/mosra/magnum-examples)
    and [AppVeyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mosra/magnum-examples), with code
    coverage on [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/github/mosra/magnum-examples);
    replacing the unmaintained and outdated Jenkins configuration
-   Support for CMake subprojects. You can now clone Magnum Plugins into a
    subdirectory in your project and add it using @cmake add_subdirectory() @ce.
    The @cmake find_package() @ce command will then use the CMake subproject
    instead of looking for it in system-wide locations.
-   CMake targets are now organized in folders for better development
    experience in IDEs such as Visual Studio or Xcode
-   Added a @ref building-examples-packages-brew "Homebrew package"
-   `MACOSX_RPATH` is now enabled by default on CMake 3.0+
-   Enabling only C++ in CMake @cmake project() @ce call, if possible, to speed
    up initial CMake run

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   Fixed depth issues in the @ref examples-viewer example when running with
    16bit depth buffer ([possibly related Firefox bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1202387))
-   Fixed Greek text in the @ref examples-text example

@subsection changelog-examples-latest-documentation Documentation

-   New documentation theme powered by [m.css](http://mcss.mosra.cz) and
    related massive updates of *everything*
-   All examples, even the ones without a tutorial, have now their dedicated
    documentation page with a screenshot, source listing and possibly a link
    to the live web version
-   The @ref building-examples documentation now prefers package installation
    instead of manual build
